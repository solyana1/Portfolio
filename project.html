        <p>Angel is a mobile and desktop application designed to provide a safer way to store content on the cloud. In the a time of data breaches and unethical marketing practices, it is imperative for there to be a trustworthy service that offers simple and effective ways to keep your files out of the hands of unauthorized users. </p>

      <h4>DISCOVERY</h4>
        <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>The core problem with existing cloud storage tools is that they don’t provide users the security they need to protect their data from hackers.</p>
          <img src="images/security.png" alt="security">
        <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>To ensure that users have a peace of mind when utilizing their cloud contents, Angel allows users to securely create, organize, and share content by:</p>
            <img src="images/one.png" alt="number 1">
              <p>enabling users to choose how they share content</p>

            <img src="images/three.png" alt="number 3">
              <p>assuring users that their information is stored safely</p>

      <h4>STRATEGY</h4>
        <h5>User Survey</h5>
          <p>After receiving the client brief, I began my research by conducting a user survey to understand the utilization of existing cloud storage services and to learn of any user concerns or frustrations that can be resolved through this app. The result were as follows:</p>
            <img src="images/surveyresults.png" alt="survey results">
        <h5>SWOT Analysis</h5>
          <p>After analyzing my user survey, I went on to study my competition. I conducted a SWOT analysis on:</p>
            <img src="images/SWOT.png" alt="SWOT">
          <p>Based on my competitive analysis, I found implementing security features  to be a big opportunity. In addition, tackling privacy and security concerns would be a differentiating factor that could set Angel apart from its competition.</p>
      <h4>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h4>
        <h5>User Personas</h5>
          <img src="images/personas.png" alt="personas">
        <h5>User Flows and User Stories</h5>
          <p>Then, I created user flows to break down some of the paths users would need to take to complete key tasks such as signing up, uploading, creating and sharing content.</p>
            <img src="images/userflow.png" alt="user flows">
            <a href="assets/completeuserflow.pdf"> View All User Flows </a>
          <p>Next, I wrote a user story with different users in mind. I identified 40 tasks in total that new, returning as well as all users would want in a new cloud storage solution. After compiling those tasks, I prioritized them in order of importance. </p>

        <h5>Sketches and Wireframes</h5>
          <p>Next I crated wireframes and turned them into clickable prototypes to test my initial design for this storage service. Other than minor flaws with the sign up process, my participants found completing key tasks such as uploading, creating and sharing content to be straightward.</p>

            <img src="images/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes">
            <h4>VISUAL DESIGN</h4>
        <h5>Branding:Name, Logo, Style Guide</h5>
          <p>Next I began to brainstorm names for my brand and came up with ‘Angel’ after mapping out words that related to my brand strategy to symbolize the protection and security. Then I went on to sketching out a few logo design ideas using pen and paper. Once I had a good idea of direction I wanted to take with the simple “A” shaped logo, I turned that into digital designs using Figma as depicted on the right.</p>

            <img src="images/logosketches.png" alt="logosketches">
         <P>In order to maintain consistency, I defined how the logo, color, typography and other assets are to be used in reference to this cloud storage service.</P>
        <img src="images/styleguide.png" alt="Style Guide">
        <h5>Hi-fi Mockups and Itterations</h5>
        <p>After solidifying some of the visuals for this cloud storage service, I applied the branding work to my high-fidelity mockups.</p>
        <img src="images/mockups.png" alt="Mockups">
        <h5>Preference and Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>I conducted A/B and usability tests to ensure users were able to navigate through the app seamlessly. I learned that my initial icons for the mobile version of the design was confusing to my users. Therefore, I recreated those icons with added description below them. In addition, participants like having the 3 options to create, share, and upload as opposed to the single plus floating action button. </p>

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p>The main takeaway for me was how imperative testing is especially in the beginning phase of the design process. Putting multiple initial ideas in front of testers early on during the wireframe phase can save tremendous amount of time as opposed to introducing new ideas later on during the mockup stage. Even though I did not test enough ideas as I could have right after completing my wireframes, I was able to incorporate essential iterations to my prototypes through preference and usability testing.</p>
